# Distance Sharp IR Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes a Sharp infrared (IR) sensor to measure distance. The sensor works based on the principle of triangulation, where it emits an infrared beam and calculates the distance by measuring the reflection time. This project provides a simple way to interface the sensor with an Arduino Nano and obtain distance measurements.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Sharp IR Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the VCC pin of the sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the OUT pin of the sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the Sharp IR sensor to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.
  
2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the distance readings displayed on the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Distance Sensing:** Used in robotics, automation, and various projects requiring proximity detection.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Employed in robotics for obstacle detection and avoidance.
- **Gesture Recognition:** Used to detect hand gestures and movements in interactive projects.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper wiring and connection between the sensor and the Arduino Nano.
- Calibrate the sensor according to your specific application requirements.
- Experiment with different sensor models and distances to understand their characteristics better.
